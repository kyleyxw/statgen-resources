# Resources for Statistical Genetics

This repository lists resources needed for [GWAS](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/course/gwas-catalog-exploring-snp-trait-associations-2019/what-gwas-catalog/what-are-genome-wide) and statistical genetics.

The content is mainly aimed for people starting in the field of statistical genetics. 

There are four lists:

- Publicly available [genetic data](statgen-data.md) (raw or summarized).
- [Readings](statgen-reading.md), mostly research articles.
- [Software](statgen-software.md) to perform statistical analyses on genetic data.
- [Learning](statgen-learning.md) material.

## Getting started

Podcast about [GWAS](https://everythinghertz.com/85) (_GWAS big teeth you have, grandmother_) by [Everything Hertz](https://everythinghertz.com/) (with [Kevin Mitchell](https://twitter.com/WiringTheBrain)).

High-level [GWAS introduction](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/training/online/course/gwas-catalog-exploring-snp-trait-associations-2019/what-gwas-catalog/what-are-genome-wide) by GWAS catalog.


## Contribute
 
I have started this collection while working on [my PhD thesis](https://drive.switch.ch/index.php/s/FpWZlbw4Rfq20le) and hope it can be extended continuously.

If you would like to contribute to any of these lists, please make a pull request or file an [issue](https://github.com/sinarueeger/statistical-genetics-ressources/issues).
